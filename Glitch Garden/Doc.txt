For lizard box collider - have it connected to animations (maybe immune during jump etc.)
fix lizard shape - the particle effect spawns in the middle of the box, not the collider

sometimes when spawning a cactus/defender, they spawn in the middle of their animation
    > I spawned three cacti, the first spawned with the sprite ~Idle_0, the next at Idle_19, and the third at Idle_20 and was slightly pink

if you want to spawn a defender, and you click on an attacker, sometimes nothing happens -> due to z-depth-fighting




current damage values:

Defenders:
    1000 hp

Attacks:
    200 Damage
