For lizard box collider - have it connected to animations (maybe immune during jump etc.)
fix lizard shape - the particle effect spawns in the middle of the box, not the collider

sometimes when spawning a cactus/defender, they spawn in the middle of their animation
    > I spawned three cacti, the first spawned with the sprite ~Idle_0, the next at Idle_19, and the third at Idle_20 and was slightly pink

if you want to spawn a defender, and you click on an attacker, sometimes nothing happens -> due to z-depth-fighting

clean up FlashRed() in health and star display - it doesn't look very good. maybe have a timer that starts when FlashRed is called, and if the timer reaches 0, then return to default colour.

jazz up the level complete with the particles etc.


FIND SOME ASSETS PLEASE :D
